1
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:03,642
How much time do we have?

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,827
Uh, t-minus five hours,
37 minutes

3
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,462
To onset of meteor shower.

4
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:10,382
Okay, our position
is 34.48 degrees north,

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,566
118.31 west.

6
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:12,818
That means the azimuth

7
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:14,135
Should be...

8
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:17,439
168.22 degrees relative
to magnetic north

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,058
With an elevation
of 49.93.

10
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:21,410
Anything yet?

11
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:25,447
Uh, we have a signal,
but there's no frame lock.

12
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:27,365
Ha. How about now?
- We did it.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,819
We have the west
coast feed of HBO.

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,705
<i>Ooh, Real Sex.</i>

15
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,424
Big deal. Every time
I watch that show

16
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,709


17
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:41,596
All right, let's see
what's on the east coast feed.

18
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:44,349
<i>Oh, hey. Dune.</i>

19
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,969
Not a great movie,

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,921
But look
at that beautiful desert.

21
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:54,374
Too bad Sheldon
couldn't come with us.

22
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,459
Oh it's just not the same without him.

23
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,669
<i>Oh, this sucks
I'm switching back to Real Sex.</i>

24
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,525
Sheldon's log.
star date 63345.3

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,394
While my colleagues are off

26
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,195
Observing the Leonid
meteor shower,

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,865
I have remained behind
to complete my paper

28
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:26,166
On the decays of highly excited
massive string states.

29
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,203
Although my research is going well

30
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,707
I do miss the warmth of human companionship.

31
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,878
Hahaha.

32
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,031
And good evening to you,
Siam Palace.

33
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:08,666
This is Sheldon Cooper.

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,101
Yeah, I'm going to be
dining alone this evening,

35
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:12,603
So I'll be reducing
my usual order.

36
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,473
I'd like to start
with one quarter

37
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,208
Of the assorted appetizers plate

38
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:21,229
And, uh, one half
of the golden treasure for two.

39
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:23,197
Oh, for heaven's sake

40
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,765
In the mid-18th century,

41
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:27,652
King Rama IV of Siam
divided a huge empire

42
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,570
Amongst the colonial powers
of Europe

43
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,272
In order to preserve his throne.

44
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:33,207
Surely, you,
his cultural descendant,

45
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,743
Can handle pad Thai
and dumplings.

46
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,578
Sheldon help!

47
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,048
I need to go--
but you keep in mind

48
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,499
That my sharply worded comments

49
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,634
On yelp.Com recently took down
a local muffin store.

50
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,658
Penny. Penny. Penny.

51
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:53,479
Come in! Hurry!

52
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:56,113
Penny?

53
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,481
I'm back here.

54
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:04,972
Penny. Penny. Penny.

55
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:08,309
Oh, for god's sakes,
I'm in the bathroom!

56
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:11,662
Shall I come back
at a better time?

57
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,281
Get in here! Hurry!

58
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,282
Don't you dare knock.

59
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:23,583
Hello.

60
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:25,732
I slipped in the shower,

61
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,733
And I think I dislocated my shoulder.

62
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,451
Not surprising.

63
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,587
You have no safety mat
or adhesive stickers

64
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,539
To allow for purchase on a surface

65
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,175
With a low coefficient
of static friction.

66
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,277
What?

67
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,646
Tubs are slippery.

68
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,965
I know. I slipped.

69
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,000
I have a series
of whimsical duck stickers

70
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,052
On the bottom of my tub.

71
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,187
Yeah, okay, whatever.

72
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,022
Will you just turn the water off
and help me up?

73
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,008
They're holding
umbrellas.

74
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,727
what?

75
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,278
The ducks in my tub.

76
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,646
Uh-huh.

77
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,647
They're whimsical because ducks
have neither the need for

78
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,735
Nor the ability to use umbrellas.

79
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,187
Oh, my god. I got to go
to the emergency room.

80
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:08,489
Well, assuming you're correct
that your right humerus

81
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,158
Is no longer seated
in the glenoid socket,

82
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,810
I would certainly think so.
Okay, can you drive me?

83
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,245
I don't drive.

84
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,396
Well, I can't drive!

85
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,249
Well, it seems we've reached
an impasse.

86
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:19,584
Ow.

87
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,403
I could call you a cab
or an ambulance.
No, no, no.

88
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,104
I can't wait that long.

89
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:24,472
You got to help me, please.

90
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:28,493
All right. Let it never be said
that Sheldon Lee Cooper

91
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,612
Ignored the pleas
of a damsel in distress.

92
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,430
No one's saying that.
Let's go.

93
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:34,165
Well, it does seem rather ironic

94
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,418
That for want
of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

95
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,487
We both might die
in a fiery car crash.

96
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,540
I wish Penny didn't for want
didn't have to work.

97
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,675
She loves camping.

98
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,293
Yeah, that would
have been great.

99
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:46,978
You and Penny having sex
in the tent

100
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:49,831
While I sit out here
and watch Howard hump a cactus.

101
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:54,469
Okay, the best I can tell,

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,054
There are eight other
camp-sites nearby.

103
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,505
Mostly science nerds like us,

104
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:00,642
But just over yon
ridge are two

105
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,527
Not unattractive
middle school teachers

106
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,362
Who reek of desperation.

107
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:06,314
Wow. Wonderful.

108
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:09,701
How old are they?
Oh I don't know. 50, 55.

109
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:12,621
Oh, menopause.

110
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:16,157
Nature's birth control.

111
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,325
Come on.

112
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,077
You guys can't be that hard up.

113
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,195
I am.
Yeah, me, too.

114
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,583
Look-- they gave me home-made cookies
of course, they did.

115
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:27,252
That's what grandmothers do.

116
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:28,887
So, what are we waiting for?

117
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:29,988
Relax.

118
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,806
I said we'd stop by
a little later

119
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,925
After they have their nap.

120
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,010
Good idea.

121
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,177
They'll be refreshed.

122
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,595
Cookie?

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,380
Yeah. Thank you.

124
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:44,402
Not bad.

125
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:45,820
Yeah, very tasty.

126
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,555
Well, so tell me more
about these teachers.

127
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:48,857
Not much to tell.

128
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:50,575
They had a VW Microbus

129
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,578
And were wearing tie-dyed
Grateful Dead shirts.

130
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,447
Huh.

131
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,666
Mmm.

132
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,751
Good cookies.

133
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:08,576
I see no organizational
system in here whatsoever.

134
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,263
Which panties do you
wear on Mondays?

135
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,032
I don't need panties.

136
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,734
I just need shorts
and a shirt.

137
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,286
My mother always told me one
should wear clean underpants

138
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:19,938
In case one is in an accident.

139
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,057
One was already in an accident.

140
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,725
That doesn't mean one
won't be in another,

141
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:25,143
Especially if I'm driving.

142
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:26,361
Clothes, Sheldon.

143
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:27,729
I need clothes!
Okay.

144
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,481
Here.

145
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:31,266
Seriously?
Those shorts with that top?

146
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,936
All right.

147
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,822
No.

148
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,743
No.

149
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,495
Oh, that's cute.

150
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,965
We should have you checked
for a concussion.

151
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,750
okay.

152
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,921
Now, you got to help me
put these on.

153
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,923
All right.
But don't look.

154
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,793
Don't look?
I don't want you
to see me naked.

155
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:56,877
Oh.

156
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:58,529
Well, that's understandable.

157
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:02,001
You may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking

158
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:04,185
Is well established
in heroic mythology.

159
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:07,371
Uh, Lot and his wife,
Perseus and Medusa,

160
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,223
Orpheus and Eurydi...
Yeah, great.

161
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:10,274
They always look.

162
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,143
It never ends well.

163
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:14,756
Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm
into the sleeve.

164
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:15,757
Ok.

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,408
Is that my arm?

166
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,447
It doesn't feel
like an arm.

167
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,350
Then, maybe you
should let it go.

168
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,204
All righty.

169
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,523
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

170
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:53,524
Up above the world so high,

171
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:57,077
Like little diamonds in the sky.

172
00:07:57,145 --> 00:08:00,413
That's beautiful, dude.

173
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,115
You should...
You should write that down

174
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,012
Before someone steals it.

175
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,714
- So, when do the meteors get here?
- The meteors don't get here.

176
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,766
The earth is moving
into their path.

177
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,718
I can feel it.

178
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:17,123
I can feel
the earth moving.

179
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,392
It's moving too fast.

180
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,144
Raj, slow it down.

181
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,172
Okay, how's that?

182
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,875
Better. Thanks.

183
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:38,411
Stars are pretty,
aren't they?

184
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,417
What's so funny?

185
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:45,852
It's your American accent.

186
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,420
Everything you say
sounds stupid.

187
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,791
"stars are pretty, aren't they?"

188
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,178
For the record, I
should let you know

189
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,848
This is my first time driving
an actual motor vehicle.

190
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:09,918
You have your
learner's permit, right?

191
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:11,353
Yes, and I have logged

192
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,922
A considerable number of hours
on a simulator.

193
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,608
- Good.
- Didn't work out well.

194
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:18,610
All right,
can we please go?
One moment.

195
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,545
According to my driver's ed book,
a side mirror is properly adjusted

196
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,005
When a portion of the is
driver's door handle

197
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:26,640
Is visible in the
lower right corner.

198
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:27,725
There's the handle.

199
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,126
Oh, no, too far.

200
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,845
Bringing it back.

201
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,230
Optimized.

202
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:34,932
Now, where is the switch

203
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,067
To adjust
the passenger side mirror?

204
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,986
It's right there.

205
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:42,823
Where is the passenger
side mirror?

206
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,026
In a parking lot in Hollywood.

207
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,670
- Now, can we please go?
- Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat.

208
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:54,006
Whee!

209
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:00,963
Oh, dear.

210
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,899
I'm going to have
start again.

211
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,743
If I could speak
the language of rabbits,

212
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:18,414
They would be amazed,
and I would be their king.

213
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:21,086
I hate my name.

214
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,488
It has "nerd" in it.

215
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,561
Len-nerd.

216
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,948
I lost my virginity
to my cousin Jeanie.

217
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:40,053
I would be kind
to my rabbit subjects.

218
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,990
At first.

219
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,727
You know what's a cool name?

220
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,246
Angelo.

221
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:53,649
That has angel and jell-o in it.

222
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:56,786
It was my Uncle Murray's
funeral.

223
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:59,255
We were all back
at my Aunt Barbara's house.

224
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:01,741
Our eyes locked
over the pickled herring.

225
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:03,793
We never meant for it to happen.

226
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:08,381
One day, I hold a great ball
for the President of France,

227
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,566
But the rabbits--
they hate me and don't come.

228
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:13,536
I am embarrassed, so I eat
all the lettuce in the world

229
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,621
And make them watch.

230
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,924
People could call me Angie.

231
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:24,180
Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?

232
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:30,398
To this day, I can't look at pickled herring
without being aroused. That is a shame.

233
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:33,952
oh! Cousin Jeanie.

234
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,660
Could you please drive
a little faster?

235
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,462
Oh, I think we're going
sufficiently fast.

236
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,083
What's that?

237
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,001
Nothing. The engine does that
sometimes.

238
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,169
It can't be nothing.

239
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,337
The check engine light is on.

240
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,755
We need
to find a service station.

241
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:56,091
No. The light has been on
since I bought the car.

242
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,475
All the more reason

243
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,262
To consult with a mechanic
before it explodes.

244
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:01,563
It's not going to explode.

245
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,848
Just keep driving.

246
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:06,101
Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

247
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:10,188
<i>Mr. Spock did not pilot
the Enterprise.</i>

248
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,941
He was the science officer,
and I guarantee you that

249
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:15,527
<i>If he ever saw the Enterprise's
check engine light blinking,</i>

250
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,330
He would pull the ship over
immediately.

251
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:21,783
Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm.

252
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:22,984
Oh, oh, red light.

253
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,153
Release accelerator

254
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:29,291
And slowly apply...
the... brake.

255
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,879
Nailed it.

256
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,968
While we have a moment,
may I ask you a question?

257
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,353
What?

258
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:43,722
Why do you have the
Chinese character for soup

259
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,840
Tattooed on your
right buttock?

260
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,609
It's not soup.

261
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,843
It's courage.

262
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:50,295
No, it isn't.

263
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:52,530
But I suppose
it does take courage

264
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:56,368
To demonstrate that kind
of commitment to soup.

265
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:58,320
How did you see it?

266
00:12:58,371 --> 00:12:59,821
You said you wouldn't look.

267
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,022
Sorry.

268
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,276
As I told you, the
hero always peeks.

269
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:14,452
Anything?

270
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,038
No. That was the last
pudding cup.

271
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,207
No!

272
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,509
What about Slim Jim's?

273
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:29,384
That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
Right! That was so good!

274
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:33,388
Sweety and meaty
at the same time.

275
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,690
Wait. Wait, wait.
So you're saying

276
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:37,075
We're out of food?

277
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,727
The only thing in here
are blue ice packs.

278
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,830
I know they're poison,

279
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:45,750
But they look like big,
yummy otter pops.

280
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,903
Oh, god, I am so hungry.

281
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:50,105
Me, too.

282
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:53,675
Check and see
if we have any more pudding.

283
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:02,634
All right, there's no need
to bark at me.

284
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,754
According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk,

285
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,306
You'll be seen after the man

286
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:10,408
who claims
to be having a heart attack,

287
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,977
But appears to be well enough

288
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,796
To play Doodle Jump
on his iphone.

289
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:17,649
We have to fill these out.

290
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,902
"describe illness or injury."

291
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:23,438
I dislocated
my shoulder.

292
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,173
All right.

293
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:27,926
And how did the accident occur?

294
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:30,412
You ready know that.

295
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,464
"cause of accident."

296
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,632
"lack of adhesive ducks."

297
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:39,421
Okay, medical history.

298
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:41,423
"Have you ever been diagnosed
with diabetes?"

299
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,024
No.
Kidney disease?

300
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,759
No.
Migraines?

301
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,811
Getting one.

302
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,431
"Are you currently
pregnant?"
no.

303
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,598
Are you sure?

304
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,883
You look a bit puffy.

305
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,137
Change migraine to yes.

306
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,357
"When was your last
menstrual period?"

307
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,992
Oh. Next question.

308
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,144
I'll put, "in progress."

309
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,532
Okay, moving
to psychiatric disorders.

310
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,367
"list all major
behavioural diagnoses,

311
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:11,436
"e.g. Depression,
anxiety, etcetera."

312
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,872
Oh, my god, what the
hell does this have

313
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,357
to do with my
stupid shoulder?!

314
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:18,659
"episodes of sub psychotic
rage."

315
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:21,596
Ass.

316
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,681
"possible tourette's."

317
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:29,270
All right. "moles, lesions
or other skin conditions."

318
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:31,856
"soup tattoo on right buttock."

319
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:33,274
Hey, Sheldon,
Sheldon, look,

320
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,643
I am scared and
in a lot of pain.

321
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:40,565
Could you please just take a
break from being you and try being--

322
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,485
I don't know--
comforting?

323
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:46,337
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,524
There, there.

325
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,794
Every thing's going
to be fine.

326
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,887
Sheldon's here.

327
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:11,146
Thanks.

328
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:13,565
That's much better.

329
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,202
Oh, I'm so hungry!

330
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,686
Will you shut up?

331
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:20,888
We're all hungry.

332
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,723
Okay, our objective is

333
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,576
The boy scout
camp-site to the east.

334
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,944
Easy target.

335
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,063
Big doughy scout master,
couple of cubs, most webelos.

336
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:30,415
What kind of score
we looking at?

337
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:31,583
Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.

338
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,168
I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.

339
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,335
All right,

340
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:36,421
Everyone grab flash lights.

341
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,543
Oh, my god, could it be?

342
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:42,844
Yes!

343
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,763
My mother put an "I love you"
brisket in my backpack.

344
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:46,747
Quick, get forks.

345
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,133
You don't need forks.

346
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,917
It's so tender,
it falls apart in your hands.

347
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,970
He's right.

348
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,897
I feel like we're forgetting
something important.

349
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:04,949
Me, too.
But what?

350
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:11,956
Maybe a Tupperware bowl
of roasted potatoes and carrots?

351
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,992
Yes!
Yes!

352
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:22,333
Now remember, you were given
powerful pain medication

353
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,052
And a muscle relaxer,

354
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,721
So, uh, don't operate
heavy machinery.

355
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,342
Try not to choke
on your own drool.

356
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,128
Wait. You have

357
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,963
To help me get into bed.

358
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,437
Sheldon has to get me into bed.

359
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:47,141
Bet you never thought
I'd say that.

360
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,194
Yes.

361
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:53,481
The charm of your drug addled
candour knows no bounds.

362
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:59,621
You know, people think
you're this weird robot man

363
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:03,091
Who's so annoying all the time,
and you totally are.

364
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:07,545
<i>But then it's like that movie
Wall-e at the end.</i>

365
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,631
You're so full of love,

366
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,999
And you can save a plant

367
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:15,737
And get fat people
out of the floaty chairs.

368
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:20,892
That's a fairly laboured metaphor,
but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

369
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,145
Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

370
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,784
"Soft Kitty" is for
when you're sick.

371
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,018
You're not sick.

372
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,322
Injured and drugged
is a kind of sick.

373
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:49,587
soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

374
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:50,888
Wait, wait.

375
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,974
Let's sing it as a round.

376
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,309
I'll start.

377
00:18:55,894 --> 00:19:03,117
soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

378
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,855
I'll start over.

379
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:14,051
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur

380
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,455
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.

381
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:27,809
soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fur... 

382
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,994
happy kitty,
sleepy kitty 

383
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:32,297
happy kitty,
sleepy kitty

384
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,215
happy kitty,
purr, purr, purr

385
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:38,486
purr, purr, purr. 

386
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,627


387
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:47,294
...And the next morning
when he woke up,

388
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:50,664
He rolled over and realized...

389
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,800
duh-duh-duh! 

390
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:56,270
...She was his cousin.

391
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:05,763
That's still not funny.

392
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:09,033
That's still not funny.

393
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:13,520
And she was my second cousin.

394
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,155
And she was my
second cousin.

395
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:20,711
You're a real douche.

396
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:23,213
Who cares?
You slept with your cousin.

397
